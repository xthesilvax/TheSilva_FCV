# Best Modification of the [Fix-Clean Vehicle Command v1.2.5](https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-fx-fix-clean-vehicle-command/39409)

## Explaining the reason for the modification
I started by changing this script because I thought it was an interesting idea but it was a little poorly programmed and not developed so I decided to improve, that's why I released this version :)

## Installation
Just put it in the base and start the script in the **"server.cfg"** file.
```
start TheSilva_FCV
```
**OR**
```
ensure TheSilva_FCV
```

## Usage
If you are in a vehicle you can repair it with the **/fix** command or clean it with the **/clean** command.

## Config
Open the *"config.lua"* file and change what you need!

**everyoneAllowed** - It is False at default.
  - True - Everyone is allowed to use the command, you do not need to add anyone to the allowed table
  - False - You need to add people to the allowed table to give them permission to use the table

**AllowedList** - Enter your steam IDs and IPs. DO NOT forget the commas and do not add a comma at the end.

## Change Log
### v1.2.5 [Original] (Murfasa)
- Added whitelist for steamIDs and IPs
- Added /clean command
- Refined /fix’s functionality

### v1.0 [Modified]
- Add a config file [(Without Mod)](https://prnt.sc/c_KNQ1EpqggF)
